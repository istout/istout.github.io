    </header>

        <section>
            <h2>How the website was built:</h2>
            <p> This page uses html, javascript (.js), styling sheets (.css) as the basic building blocks. To retrieve streamflow forecasts, it uses the National Water Models API. 
         

            <h2>HTML Structure</h2>
            <p>This is built on a HTML file (A9_WWRaft.html). The HTML file is where the majority of the stuff you see when you open the webpage is shown. It is what sets up the positioning of all then contents of the page. The HTML includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> The header and footer block which runs along the top and bottom of the webpage</li>
                <li>Links to the styling sheet (.css) and javascript (.js) files.</li>
                <ul>   
                    <li>The styling sheet (.css) tells the html what the page and text should look like such as the color, font, positioning on page, etc.</li>
                    <li>The javascript (.js) file allows the user to interact with the website like pushing buttons that will perform functions. The javascript houses theses functions.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Containers or "designated sections" for the map and forecast </li>
                <li>Checkboxes for each of the rivers</li>
                <li>Links to the "How it works" section and the "About Me" section  </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Styling Sheets (A9_WWRaft.css)</h2>
            <p>The styling sheets with the extension (.css) is where the "aesthetics" for the web page are determined. </p>
            <p>In the HTML file, everything is given a certain tag to define it.</p>
            <p>These tags allow the .css page to add a certain look to everything with the same tag. </p>
            <p> For example, anything inside the "body" of the page will have generally have these aesthetics applied to them. </p>
                <p>In the .css file:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            body {
                                font-family: sans-serif;
                                margin: 20px;
                                line-height: 1.6;
                                color: #333;
                                background-color: #f8f9fa;
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <p> Oh, also, did you notice how the code that was just shown was in it's own little black box with white text?</p>
                <p>You did? GOOD</p>
                <p>That was specified in the .css file.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Javascript Functionality (A9_WWRaft.js)</h2>
            <p>The javascript file is what holds most of the logic of the application and page. It allows the page to be more interactive for the user.</p>
            <p> For this page specifically, the javascript contains instrutions for the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What to show on the map when the page is opened initially</li>
                <li>What to show when different check boxes are clicked</li>
                <li>Events that trigger functions to run</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Setting up the map</h3>
            <p>The javascript tells the map what to initially show and zoom to upon opening the web page. It adds the underlying baselayer that is active always.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    var map = L.map('map').setView([36.5, -106], 8.5);
                    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
                        maxZoom: 19,
                        attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
                    }).addTo(map);
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h3>Map Layers</h3>
            <p>This page has 5 different rivers it can show. The shapefile for each river is loaded onto a <a href='https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/d6eeb177c15544fc9976b15278368adc/' target="_blank">Hydroshare resource.</a> Each river is saved into a constant called "layers" in the javascript. As a checkbox is toggled, the corresponding river will be displayed on the map and the forecast will be run. </p>
            <p>In simple terms, the code is running through if statements to determine which functions to run when a checkbox is toggled on. To connect the functions to the checkbox, an event listener was added. Below is an example:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    document.getElementById('River1').addEventListener('change', function() {
                        toggleCheckbox(this, 'River1');
                    });
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <h3>Forecast data</h3>
            <p>When a river is selected, the forecast data is pulled from the National Water Model API. The API is called using the fetch function. The data is then parsed and displayed on the page as a table and chart. </p>

            <p>To add the chart and table, a javascript plugin is used. In the html header it's loaded in. </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js">
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p> Similar to how the river shapefiles were stored as a constant, the corresponding reach ID's were stored as a list. When the user clicked on the checkbox, the website makes an API call to the NOAA NWPS API using the fetch API:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const apiUrl = `https://api.water.noaa.gov/nwps/v1/reaches/${riverReachID}/streamflow?series=${seriesType}`;
                    const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p> The ${riverReachID} and ${seriesType} allows the input fetch API to change based on the river chosen.</p>
            <p> After the API call is made, the code parses the JSON response. Specifically to this project, this was the trickiest part of the code. Depending on the series type, (short_range,medium_range, etc.) the JSON response formatting is different. The data needed for the table isn't always stored under the same section. Due to this, the JSON path is hardcoded for these rivers. If other rivers are formatted the same way, the code will work, otherwise it will throw an error. </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let streamflowData = "";
                    if (seriesType === 'short_range') {
                    streamflowData = json_data[seriesTypeshort].series.data;
                    } else if (seriesType === 'medium_range') {
                    streamflowData = json_data.mediumRange.member6.data;
                    }else if (seriesType === 'long_range') {
                    streamflowData = json_data.longRange.member4.data;
                    }else if (seriesType === 'medium_range_blend') {
                    //  streamflowData = json_data.mediumRangeBlend.series.data;
                    streamflowData = json_data[seriesTypeshort].series.data;
                    }

                    // Check if the streamflow data is empty
                    if (!streamflowData || streamflowData.length === 0) {
                    throw new Error('No forecast data available for selected series type.');
                    }

                    const timestamps = streamflowData.map(item => item.validTime);
                    const flowValues = streamflowData.map(item => item.flow);
